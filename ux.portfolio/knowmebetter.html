                <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my portfolio! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jordan and I'm currently a NYU sophomore majoring in integrated digital media.
In March of 2020, I had no choice but to leave school and return home to Hong Kong in the midst of the global pandemic. Though not ideal, this situation surprisingly opened up a new door to my life. Up til that summer I didnâ€™t have a clear idea of which branch I wanted to pursue in tech, and it wasnâ€™t until I had a Zoom catch up with my friend where she introduced me to product design. I was immediately drawn to the creative process of UX and dedicated the rest of my summer self-learning through online courses and resources to explore the fundamentals of the discipline. I found myself knee deep into creating projects and it was all I did day in and day out! Knowing that product design would potentially allow me to apply my knowledge into creating impactful solutions for the wider community, I couldnâ€™t help but envision myself pursuing this path for the long run.
I'm currently working hard to master the principles of UX, and I canâ€™t wait to see what opportunities are out there for me in the future. For now, feel free to check out some of my work!

                        <p>One of my favourite sports is scuba diving! So far, I have an advanced open water license and have dived in the Maldives, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. Scuba diving all around the world is definitely something on my bucket list.</p>

                        <p>Iâ€™m currently super excited to get good at UX design, but eventually, I would like to design UX for augmented reality. Iâ€™m intrigued by what seems like a science-fiction trope turning into absolute, unquestionable reality.</p>
