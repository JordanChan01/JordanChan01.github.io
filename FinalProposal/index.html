  <h1>Final Proposal Topic</h1>
  <section id="mainbody">
      <div class="text"><p id="text1">Topic: I'm planning to make an interactive website that introduces each member in the Korean boy band BTS. Since each of them have such different personalitites and roles within the group, I think it would be fun to base my website around their individuality and I want to capture the group's overall synergy by creating an aestehtic that represents their message as artists.</p></div>
      <div ><img src="topic.jpg" alt="pic1" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;"class="image" ></div>
      <div ><img src="context.jpg" alt="pic2" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;"class="image" ></div>
      <div class="text"><p id="text2">Context: I've been a fan of BTS for over four years and they were a huge part of my teenage years so I want to take this opportunity to make something related to my interests and hobbies instead of work related topics. BTS also started gaining a lot of popularity in the past two years so the website could be a way to educate more people about K-pop and Korean Culture.
