           style = "font-family: 'serif';">Publicity proposes to those in a consumer society that we can change ourselves by buying something more. And publicity persuades us of this transformation by showing us people who have been transformed and that are, as a result, more enviable. This state of being envied is what constitutes glamour. Berger compares the concept of glamour to traditional oil paintings and asserts that envy did not exist back then because people valued authority and elegance over a glamorous life. In todayâ€™s times, we are constantly surrounded and bombarded with advertisements and publicity images whether it be on digital devices, in magazines, or in banners. Just like what Berger described, these images are unconsciously telling us what material items we should possess, and the ideal lifestyle we would live if we had it. This materialism creates a culture of envy, which is something that definitely affects each and every one of us to a certain degree.</p>
