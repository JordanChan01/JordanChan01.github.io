In one category of paining, women were the principal ever occurring subject which is the category of the nude. In the European tradition, the nude implies an awareness of being seen by the spectator. They are not naked as they are, rather, they are naked as the audience see them. The idea that men and women’s centre of narcissism	 are different is something that stuck with me: a woman’s image of herself is derived from other people while a man’s image of himself is derived from the world that he lives in. Especially in the past, women were more often than not drawn to men as a source of central activity and worth while their own sense of identity was shaped as a product of their interaction with others. Although gender expectations have changed drastically over the decades, I feel that women’s images of themselves are still very much dictated by the rest of society even to this day. </p>
