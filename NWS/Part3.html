Berger argues that they are primarily an artistic medium to convey the owner’s wealth, and that the subject of the painting is not necessary art, but is the purchasing power of the merchandise. I am not one to be an expert at enjoying art pieces like traditional oil paintings, but I’ve always wondered what gives those pieces value. While they indeed are beautiful to the eye, I would have to agree with Berger that one other aspect that cannot be neglected when considering art's value is the fact that it embodies all the principles of displaying wealth and possessions.  </p>
