Berger raises a thought about how as soon as a meaning of a still image becomes transmittable its meaning is liable to be manipulated and transformed as it is no longer a constant. It is changed by the context in which it is viewed in such as the medium, words, and sound. This is especially true for images produced in the 21st century, as information can be accessed by anyone, anytime. It is rare for us to be seeing the original copy of most physical objects because we mostly view a reproduced version of it on our own devices. This means that it can be subject to the circumstances of our individual environments, which could potentially taint its original meaning.</p>
